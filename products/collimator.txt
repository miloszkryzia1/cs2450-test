Ralco's Multi-layer, square field, manual collimator.With a lightweight and compact design this collimator is intended for installation on both mobile and stationary X-ray equipment.This device has been designed and manufactured for skeletal investigations and ER applications.The X-ray field is defined by six pairs of shutters, four of which are lead-lined. The six pairs of shutters move perpendicularly within the X-ray field. Two pairs of brass shutters are located near the focus, two are located near the entrance window and two are located near the exit window of the X-ray beam from the collimator. The latter shutters serve to accurately define the X-ray field edges. Shutter movements are manual, controlled by two knobs on the collimator front panel.
