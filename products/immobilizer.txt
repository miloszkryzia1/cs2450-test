Techno-Aide is proud to offer the number one option in veterinary positioning! Our premium radiolucent immobilizer troughs provide the ultimate solution for easy and reliable animal positioning*. These durable troughs features a comfortable foam sponge core completely sealed and sewn in our heavy-gauge, reinforced "Techno-Tuff" black vinyl. The unique v-shaped immobilizer design reduces motion and fall risks for animals during procedures. Each immobilizer includes four easy-to-use hook & loop strips that quickly and conveniently attach to a securely sewn hook & loop band along the entire trough. These straps can be positioned in endless ways to secure animal limbs for nearly any imaging need. Waterproof & stain proof, these anti-microbial troughs can quickly be cleaned and sanitized with any standard germicide or mild cleaner. Available in four standard sizes from small to extra large.
